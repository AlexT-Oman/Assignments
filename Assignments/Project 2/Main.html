            <p>Hello, my name is Alex I am a current Computer Science Major in his second year. I am also taking an online Udemey course to help me learn and fine tune my web development skills. Throughout this web page you will be able to see and read my achievements in both front end development and backend development. 
              My goal is to work on this site quite often so there should be relatively regular updates to this site in terms of adding new completed projects and the occasional redesign/new features. As you continue through this page please keep in mind my focus is not on web design (although I do try to learn what I can) so this site will likely not follow conventional design practices, 
              rather I ask you to look into the code of this site when judging my skills. I do aim to have as much of the code needed for this site to be up on my github so please make sure to take a look at that. Along with that I also have a link to my LinkedIn profile if you would like to see my more traditional Resume or contact me via that way. 
              I should add If you wish to contact me, the best option is to give me a call using the phone number at the top of the screen. That is my mobile phone so I can receive text or calls any time of day. Thank you!</p>
