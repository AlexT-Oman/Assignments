            <p>Hello, my name is Alex I am a current Computer Science Major in his second year. I am also taking an
              online Udemey course to help me learn and fine tune my web development skills. Throughout this web page
              you will be able to see and read my achievements in both front end development and backend development.
              My goal is to work on this site quite often so there should be relatively regular updates to this site in
              terms of adding new completed projects and the occasional redesign/new features. As you continue through
              this page please keep in mind my focus is not on web design (although I do try to learn what I can) so
              this site will likely not follow conventional design practices,
              rather I ask you to look into the code of this site when judging my skills. I do aim to have as much of
              the code needed for this site to be up on my github so please make sure to take a look at that. Along with
              that I also have a link to my LinkedIn profile if you would like to see my more traditional Resume or
              contact me via that way.
              I should add If you wish to contact me, the best option is to give me a call using the phone number at the
              top of the screen. That is my mobile phone so I can receive text or calls any time of day. Thank you!</p>

              <span>Who am I:</span>
              <br>
              Hello, I'm Alex, a 22-year-old college student actively seeking full-time employment while pursuing
              part-time studies. Committed to enhancing my skills,
              I've enrolled in an online Udemy bootcamp to specialize in development. Proficient in languages like C++,
              Python, HTML, and CSS, I'm eager to add JavaScript to my toolkit soon.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Why You Should Consider Me:</span>
              <br>
              Dedication defines my work ethic. I thrive on challenges, meet deadlines unfailingly, and love to learn. I
              actively seek ways to improve efficiency, whether
              through side projects or refining existing processes. Having completed one year of college and 20% of my
              bootcamp, I aim to earn my associate's degree by 2024 and complete the bootcamp
              before spring of the same year. Despite part-time schooling, I go above and beyond, driven by my passion
              for development.
              <br><br>
              <span>Final Note:</span>
              <br>
              With a strong dedication to my work, I am confident in being a valuable asset to any team and
              organization. While an investment, I assure you of a substantial payoff.
              Let's connect for an interview â€“ a chance to meet face-to-face and explore how I can contribute to your
              company's success.
