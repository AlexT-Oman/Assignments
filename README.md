# Assignments
Please note that comments might be scarce throughout this repository as most of these already had code in them when I downloaded them. This repository is better used as a way to watch my growth as a developer rather than my raw skill as one.

If you would like to have a better understanding of the course work/course I am taking you can find this course on Udemey under the name "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu
